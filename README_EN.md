## 💡 What Is the "ZeroCode Engine"?

The **ZeroCode Engine** is a revolutionary backend development platform that enables you to **generate secure, stable, and high-performance enterprise-grade APIs without writing any server-side code**—just through simple configuration!

Whether you're a startup, an SME, or a large enterprise, ZeroCode Engine helps you:

- ✅ **Dramatically reduce development costs**: Break the backend bottleneck—frontend developers, product managers, and even non-technical team members can build full systems  
- ✅ **Accelerate business iteration**: Deploy new features in **minutes**, not days or weeks  
- ✅ **Prevent business logic from being locked in individual developers' hands**: Configuration is your code—knowledge becomes a shared asset  
- ✅ **Standardize API output**: Built-in enterprise capabilities like authentication, logging, rate limiting, and caching—ready out of the box  

> 🔒 **Note**: The ZeroCode Engine itself is a **closed-source commercial product**. However, to help developers experience its power, we’ve open-sourced two complete demo projects built entirely on this engine!
